## Adding your own matchers

Similar to how `expect-webdriverio` extends Jasmine/Jest matchers it's possible to add custom matchers.

- Jasmine see [custom matchers](https://jasmine.github.io/2.5/custom_matcher.html) doc
- Everyone else see Jest's [expect.extend](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectextendmatchers)
